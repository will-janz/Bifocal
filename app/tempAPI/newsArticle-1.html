<p class="subheading">After 40 years in real estate and 27 years as a real estate attorney, I have seen everything there is to see in the commercial leasing realm. Today, I will teach you about screening commercial tenants.</p>

<hr />

<p>Unlike residential leasing, due diligence of commercial tenants is a complicated business. Getting it right is, in fact, so challenging that otherwise smart and successful owners, managers, and agents occasionally skip it.</p>

<p>Given today's array of affordable and easy-to-use "big data" and risk-mitigation tools, there is no longer any excuse for this. Accordingly, if you are screening tenants the same way you did when Ronald Reagan was president, or not screening at all, I propose to fix that.</p>

<p>The purpose of this article is to bring attention to what I consider best practices. I will also explore minimum practices and "malpractices."</p>

<p>In this article I will also review and discuss the new "Key Screen" service from Open Book Ben. They are the youngest, but in my opinion the nimblest, of the four national commercial credit bureaus.</p>

<h3>Identification of the problem: "Data Widget Corp."</h3>

<p>This is a real case study. I am changing the company names to protect the not-so-innocent.</p>

<p>Commerce Plaza is mid-size suburban office building. It has 200,000 square feet. It is 80% occupied. Suite 500 is the biggest of its three remaining suites. Suite 500 has about 19,000 square feet. The space has been on the market for 14 months.</p>

<p>At long last a company, let's call it "Data Widget Corp.," shows up to rent Suite 500. They are a 40-employee, start-up, technology firm. They have been in business nine months. They are highly celebrated. Although new, there are articles in the local business journal touting them as the next Linked-In or Instagram.</p>

<p>After the usual haggling, hemming, and hawing among the brokers and the principals, terms are reached. Everyone is happy with a proposed five-year lease at $19.00 per foot. It is a $2.3 million deal, reduced to NPV, less broker fees of $100,000 and TI of $175,000.</p>

<p>At this point, we are ready to identify the problem. How do you screen Data Widget Corp. prior to lease signing? How do you evaluate their creditworthiness and default risk? Presently, the industry generally breaks down into three categories of people:</p>

<h3>1. The Gambler</h3>

<p>About one-third of owners, managers, and agents feel the pressure of the deal. In their mind's eye, they see Data Widget Corp.'s $31,666 monthly rent check and little else. We have all been there!</p>

<p>This category of owners will often sign the Data Widget Corp. lease without any meaningful due diligence. I call these owners the "Gamblers."</p>

<p>To be fair to some of them, they might actually conduct or delegate minimal perfunctory due diligence. Examples include internet searches of the company and its officers. Gamblers might also require Data Widget Corp. to provide trade references. These references may or may not actually receive a phone call. And who cares: most start-up companies will have questionable trade references, at best.</p>

<p>Some Gamblers may ask for a personal guaranty from Data Widget Corp.'s CEO. But since nothing can get in the way of a good deal, Gamblers will withdraw the request if there is any chance it might sink the lease. Gamblers may justify the decision by noting that Data Widget Corp. has 40 employees, and is optimistically bandied about in the newspaper. That's a type of reference, right? It must therefore be robust enough to pay the rent.</p>

<h3>2. The Check-The-Boxer - minimum practices</h3>

<p>Check-the-boxers are interested in the due diligence process because they know it is important. Yet tenant screening needs to know its place. The Check-The-Boxer's internal due diligence process often is designed to confirm and support a decision already made, not contradict it. Examples of Check-the-Boxer due diligence will often include:</p>

<ul class="bulleted">
	<li>Ordering a commercial credit report on the tenant from one of the four major commercial credit bureaus</li>
	<li>Requesting financials from the tenant's company</li>
	<li>Interview prior landlords and trade references</li>
	<li>Credit check of the tenant's CEO; get a personal guaranty</li>
	<li>Public records check of the tenant's company.</li>
</ul>

<p>These are obviously good productive steps. Unfortunately, these avenues are less-than-conclusive. Based on the real case study, which occurred in Tampa, Florida, here is what these screening techniques yielded:</p>

<ul class="bulleted">
	<li>Credit bureau report: The owner started by purchasing a full, premium Dun &amp; Bradstreet report for $189.00. Unfortunately, Data Widget Corp. did not have a complete record. The owner then purchased an Equifax report. Equifax showed Data Widget Corp. as having reasonably good credit. <br />
	The owner did not run Experian or Open Book Ben reports. I discovered later that Experian did not have a report, anyway. Open Book Ben did. Open Book Ben showed Data Widget Corp. as having a 63/100, which is extremely poor.</li>
	<li>Financials: The owner did request financials. Data Widget Corp. provided a year-to-date profit-and-loss report and three-year pro-forma projections. The report showed that the company had revenues of $175,000 and expenses of over $5 million. The pro-formas showed that the company would turn profitable about one year after the lease commenced.</li>
	<li>References: Data Widget corp. provided three vendor references. It did not provide a former landlord reference. Had the owner contacted the former landlord, he would have learned the Data Widget Corp. promptly paid all rent due under a six-month small office lease. Most of the company employees worked from home.</li>
	<li>CEO credit check: The owner checked the CEO's credit and determined that he had above average personal credit. His vantage score was 706 with TransUnion. His FICO score was 690 through Experian. The owner requested a personal guaranty. The CEO provided it.</li>
	<li>Public records: The owner did not do a public records search. That is because one public record showed up on the Equifax report and the owner assumed he saw everything. The Equifax report showed a UCC filing. It was filed by an office equipment leasing company. <br />
	The owner did not search for or find records of two lawsuits against Data Widget Corp. One was brought by a shareholder who had invested in Data Widget Corp.  The suit was filed in a different state. The second was a suit filed by a consultant who claimed he was unpaid.  I note that both of these lawsuits showed up on the Open Book Ben report which the owner did not order.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3.	The Diligent Manager - Best practices.</h3>

<p>The diligent manager does none of these things.  What? Did I hear you correctly, Stuart? Yes, you did. </p>

<p>When you have a lot of money on the line, do not pretend that you or your $55,000 a year property manager, or your real estate agent can double as a credit manager.  They can't. 
Do you know about the five C's? Are you confident that you will be able to find all the documents and data you need to make an informed decision? Do you have access to tools and databases you need? No, you don't. Larger companies may have specialized employees who sometimes can. But most owners do not.</p>

<p>For large deals, your lawyer is the man or woman to turn to.  Expect to pay a lawyer about $3,000 for complete due diligence on a new commercial tenant. I sometimes have to charge more for Data Widget Corp. type tenants, if they are new companies. Some of my work often involves helping you salvage a very risky deal with a start-up company, which can be done with special paperwork, collateralization, and sometimes even unique credit instruments.</p>

<p>For smaller deals, there are a number of services.  The best, as this discussion makes clear, is Open Book Ben's custom <a href="http://www.openbookben.com/keyScreen" >Key Screen service</a>. It is $500.00 for members and $1,250.00 for non-members. Membership is free. Relying on Open Book Ben's generic report by itself, however, is not an acceptable practice, although it is much better than the report you can obtain from their competitors Equifax, Experian, and Dun &amp; Bradstreet.</p>

<h3>4.	The Real Story</h3>

<p>So how did this story turn out in real life? The answer is worse that you probably expected.</p>

<p>Just prior to the signing of the lease, the CEO of Data Widget Corp. asked the owner of Commerce Plaza to lunch. The CEO was a gifted salesman. Lunch ended with the landlord eliminating the security deposit in exchange for minor stock options in Data Widget Corp.  The lease was signed the following day.</p>

<p>The owner promptly started work on the tenant improvement. It included items such as custom 8-foot glass entry doors, a granite floor in the main reception area, and an executive conference room with custom finishes. Four months later, the company moved in. </p>

<p>After only six months in suite 500, Data Widget Corp. was having trouble, according to a local business journal. Additional investors filed lawsuits. A few weeks later, two former employees filed wage claims. A local politician accused the company of fraud and demanded that the company immediately repay a $700,000 enterprise loan provided by the city a few months earlier. </p>

<p>Data Widget Corp. subsequently filed Chapter 11. Six months later the bankruptcy court rejected the company's plan of reorganization and converted the Chapter 11 to a Chapter 7. When the firm was liquidated, the owner of "Commerce Plaza" received nothing. He had previously been paid $184,000 in rent.</p>
