<p class="subheading">Pulling a credit report on a prospective commercial tenant is an essential part of a property owner or manager's due diligence. Yet not all credit reports are created equal. This article discusses the differences between Open Book Ben's tenant credit reporting products and those of our competitors.</p>

<hr />


<h3>Coverage</h3>
<p>There are approximately 29 million businesses in the United States. The vast majority of these are considered small businesses by the United States Small Business Administration. Open Book Ben is the only major commercial credit bureau with nearly complete coverage of every business – large and small – in the United States.</p>

<p>In the rare cases when Open Book Ben cannot issue a report because of a gap in coverage, we will still generally be able to fulfill requests. We do so by providing custom reporting and analytics to you at no additional charge. </p>

<p>By contrast, our competitors' databases often have significant gaps. Two of our three competitors concede that their databases have far fewer entries than the actual number of businesses in the nation. The third claims 100 million businesses. That claim perplexes us as they also say all entries are up to date. Our research confirms that their database contains historical companies (as does ours). Historical companies do not, however fill the gaps in their database which are significant.</p>


<h3>Events connected with officers and directors</h3>
<p>Open Book Ben is the only commercial credit bureau that will almost always find, detect, and report on events involving the officers, directors, and owners of a small business. These events include personal bankruptcies, criminal conviction, arrests, and lawsuits. This is provided as part of Open Book Ben's Key Screening service.  </p>

<p>We can also run personal credit checks of individual, but only with their written consent. We do not maintain a database of individual credit, and we therefore acquire this data from a third party. </p>


<h3>Tax liens and judgments</h3>
<p>Open Book Ben appears to be the only credit bureau with comprehensive coverage of tax liens and judgments.</p>
	
<h3>Regulatory enforcement actions against businesses</h3>
<p>Open Book Ben appears to be the only credit bureau that finds and reports on regulatory enforcement actions.</p>


<h3>Solving the "Thin-File" Problem</h3>
<p>One of the challenges faced by credit bureaus is what the industry calls the "thin-file problem." A large number of small businesses are start-ups.  Another large segment of the marketplace includes small companies that have very little economic activity. In other words, they are barely on the radar of the credit bureaus at all. Providing a meaningful score for such a company is a challenge. </p>

<p>Three of the four major commercial credit bureaus resolve this problem by assigning poor credit scores to thin files. Open Book Ben does not. A request for credit scoring information on a "thin file" small business triggers an automatic request for data. Sometimes, a thin file can be transformed into a complete file in real time. In other cases, the thin file must be assigned for custom research services. </p>

<p>In any event, Open Book Ben provides valuable information where our competitors often do not. We have a perfect history so far of providing data, even when our competitors have failed.</p>


<h3>Lack of financial history among start-up companies</h3>
<p>Start-up companies have little or no financial history. When they have financial reports, these often show a loss.  All four of the commercial credit reporting bureaus attempt to collect financial reports. Most firms, however, decline to share this information. Open Book Ben is often able to obtain this information, nonetheless, as it is engaged not merely to run reports, but to assist with the due diligence and screening process. You therefore have a more complete picture.</p>


<h3>Key Screening</h3>
<p>A credit report is the smallest and least expensive step in a larger tenant screening process. We recommend that you never rely solely on a report. In some cases, such as with extremely small tenants and new businesses, reliance on the report alone is bad idea.  Open Book Ben therefore offers complete Key Screening for owners and managers.</p>
