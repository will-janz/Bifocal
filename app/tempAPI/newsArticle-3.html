<p class="subheading">What happens when you cross a retired lawyer and an office building owner?  It sounds like yet another bad lawyer joke, yet the answer might surprise you:</p>

<p>You get perhaps the best commercial office lease ever drafted by Homo sapiens.</p>

<hr />

<p>You see, I am the retired lawyer and property owner in question. This lease form was good even years ago, before I hung up my lawyering shingle and went into real estate.  The real test, however, came after the form was exposed to all the peccadillos of a large number of commercial tenants.</p>

<p>While I make no guarantees that this form is right for your property – talk to your lawyer – I give this form away for free to fellow Open Book Ben community members.  </p>

<p>If you are not a member of Open Book Ben, you should be. Membership gets you not only free forms like the commercial office lease, but also real time business credit information about your tenants and prospective tenants. Other owners report into Open Book Ben. So sometimes, it is the only way you are going to find out about problem tenants.</p>

<p>For a download of the lease, please contact me at <a href="mailto:chris@cherry-creek.net">chris@cherry-creek.net</a> or through the Open Book Ben system.</p>
