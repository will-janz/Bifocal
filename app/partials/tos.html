			<h1>Dispute Resolution Between You and Other Members</h1>
			
			<p>BEN offers and administers a special, expedited dispute resolution framework for certain types commercial disputes. This framework is designed to quickly, efficiently, and cost-effectively referee and, if necessary, adjudicate certain limited disputes between you and other BEN member companies. </p>
			
			<p>The framework is called CRED-REF. It stands for "Credit Reporting Expedited Dispute Resolution Engagement Framework." It is further described in this Section.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>CRED-REF shall always apply to the following types of claims:</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Claims by your customers, suppliers, vendors, contractors, or any other parties who are members of BEN that any information or data that you provided to BEN is inaccurate, incomplete, incorrect, misleading, defamatory, or otherwise inappropriate. </li>
						<li>Claims by you that any information or data on BEN's system attributable to any third party (such as your customers, suppliers, vendors, contractors, or employees, whether BEN members or not) and contained in the Products and Services is inaccurate, incomplete, incorrect, misleading, defamatory, or otherwise inappropriate.</li>
						<li>Claims by your customers, suppliers, vendors, contractors, or other parties who are members of BEN that you are indebted to them for any amount. </li>
						<li>Your claims against your customers, suppliers, vendors, contractors or other parties who are members of BEN that they are indebted to you.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
				
				<li>CRED-REF may also apply to any other dispute submitted to BEN with the written consent of all parties, including BEN.</li>
				
				<li>The CRED-REF Framework
					<p>You agree to follow the following process and to cooperate with BEN in good faith:</p>
					
					<p><b>Step 1: Challenges</b></p>
					<ol>
						<li>Uncontested Challenges: As to items 8(A)(i) and (ii) above, you agree to first challenge the information you deem to be inaccurate, incomplete, incorrect, misleading, defamatory, or otherwise inappropriate. BEN makes challenging easy. Simply click the challenge button next to the information or data that you object to in your BEN profile. You agree to upload a short narrative and any documentary evidence you have supporting your challenge. Your challenge will generate a communication to the company that provided the information. The company may or may not be a BEN member. If they do not respond to BEN in 14 days, the information to which you objected is typically removed or alternatively, it may be subsequently noted as unconfirmed. The existence of your challenge will now also be noted. You cannot challenge information or data in another company's profile, only your own.</li>
						<li>Contested Challenges. In most cases, the company who provided the information you deem to be inaccurate, incomplete, incorrect, misleading, defamatory, or otherwise inappropriate will respond. They will be required to submit their own information, documents, narrative, or data. BEN may further request additional information, clarification, documents, or data from either you or the respondent. The matter will be assigned to a neutral referee. The referee will review all materials and, if possible, issue a short written decision. 
						<br />The referee's decision will typically (but not always) result in one of three findings: First, that the information you objected to should indeed be removed as you requested. The referee's decision may or may not discuss why. Second, that the item you objected to appears to be supported by information, documents, narrative, or data provided by the respondent, or any other reasons in the referee's opinion, and that BEN therefore should not purge the item or mark it as unverified. Third, that the records submitted by both parties conflict and for that reason, or any other in the referee's opinion, the referee cannot make a decision. If the referee cannot do so, the matter will next be subject to telephone mediation as discussed in subsection 8(C)(v) below.</li>
						<li>The costs associated with the Challenge process shall be borne by the non-prevailing party, if any, as determined by the referee. The minimum cost shall be $29.00. The maximum cost shall be $150.00. If you are the non-prevailing party, you agree to pay this sum promptly via credit card or through whatever other payments terms were set up on your BEN account. </li>
						<li>Appeal of a Referee's Decision. You can appeal the referee's decision within seven days.  Appeals are assigned to one of several referee-supervisors who are licensed attorneys. They are appointed by BEN. Appeals are handled quickly, but may require a short telephonic hearing. Appeals are handled on an hourly-fee basis and will be billed pursuant to BEN's then-prevailing rates. BEN may require a small pre-payment for the party initiating an appeal. The party who loses the appeal will typically be required to pay all fees and costs thereof. </li>
					</ol>
					
					<p><b>Step 2: Telephone Mediation</b></p>
					<ol start="5">
						<li>As to items 8(A)(iii) and (iv) above, and following any decision of the referee, you agree to participate in good-faith negotiation via telephone. It may be commenced by written notice from BEN. The notice will be sent upon request from you or any other member. Telephone mediation will take place at a mutually agreeable time and within ten (7) days of the previously described written notice.</li>
						<li>The cost of telephone mediation shall be $150.00 per hour for mediation, with a minimum charge of $250.00. BEN randomly assigns mediators. Three days prior to mediation, you agreed to provide BEN a mediation position discussing your position. BEN offers videoconferencing for no additional charge, if all parties have the capability. In cases involving subsection 8(A)(i) and (ii), the costs associated with telephone mediation shall be borne by the party who agrees to strike, withdraw, or modify information they uploaded to BEN, or pursuant to any other arrangement agreed upon by the parties. In cases involves subsections 8(A)(iii) and (iv) above, the cost of telephone mediation shall be split equally by each party, or pursuant to any other arrangement agreed upon by the parties.</li>
					</ol>
					
					<p><b>Step 3: In Person Mediation</b></p>
					<ol start="7">
						<li>If the dispute is not resolved through telephone mediation, any party to the dispute may then seek to formally mediate the dispute in person, to be held within 30 days. The mediation shall be held in Denver, Colorado, or in BEN's nearest office. The costs and responsibility for payment for In Person Mediation shall be the same as outlined in subsection 8(C)(vi) above.</li>
					</ol>
					
					<p><b>Step 4: Arbitration</b></p>
					<ol start="8">
						<li>If the dispute is not resolved through in person mediation, any party to the dispute may then submit the dispute to binding arbitration with a final arbitration hearing to be held within 60 days. BEN shall appoint the arbitrator, is generally an independent contractor. The Arbitration will be held in Denver, Colorado. The arbitrator will allow such discovery as is appropriate, consistent with the goal of accomplishing a fair, speedy, and cost-effective resolution of the dispute. Discovery will be completed, and the arbitration hearing will commence, within forty-five (45) days after appointment of the arbitrator. The arbitrator will make every effort to enforce these deadlines, but may extend the time periods for good cause shown. The arbitrator will render a written decision, including an explanation of the basis for the decision. The arbitrator may award monetary damages or direct the taking, or the refraining from taking, any action, or both, and will order that the prevailing party(ies) be reimbursed by the other party(ies) for reasonable legal fees, including attorney's fees, and other expenses incurred by the prevailing party(ies) in connection with the arbitration proceeding. <!-- @TODO: BEN's complete rules for arbitration can be found here: http://www.OpenBookBen/CRED-REF. --></li>
						<li>The procedures specified in this Section, and incorporated by reference, will be the sole and exclusive procedures for the resolution of disputes.</li>
					</ol>
				</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		
		<li>
			<h1>Dispute Resolution if you have Claims against BEN</h1>
			
			<p>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS RIGHTS THAT YOU MAY OTHERWISE HAVE. IT PROVIDES FOR RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES THROUGH MANDATORY ARBITRATION WITH A FAIR HEARING BEFORE A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR INSTEAD OF IN A COURT BY A JUDGE OR JURY OR THROUGH A CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. </p>
			
			<p>You agree to submit and all claims against BEN, as well as BEN's officers, directors, employees, agents, and representatives, to binding and confidential arbitration to be held in Jefferson County, Colorado, and pursuant to the rules of the Judicial Arbiter Group (<a href="http://jaginc.com/">http://jaginc.com/</a>). They are an independent alternative dispute resolution organization and not affiliated with BEN.</p>
			
			<p>You agree to the following preconditions prior to instituting any action against BEN: </p>
			<ol>
				<li><b>Participate in CRED-REF.</b> If you have any claims against BEN involve information, data, or contents contained in the Products and Services that you believe to be inaccurate, incomplete, incorrect, misleading, defamatory, or otherwise inappropriate, you must first follow the dispute resolution procedures in Section 8. Since some claims against BEN, in particular claims for defamation, turn on the underlying truth or falsity of the information you might object to, we agree that you will exhaust all appropriate CRED-REF remedies before you can bring a claim against BEN.   </li>
				<li><b>Notice and Cure.</b> Prior to any arbitration, mediation, claim, allegation or any other claim against BEN, you agree to give BEN notice and opportunity to cure. Written notice shall be delivered in writing to BEN via certified mail. You agree to describe with specificity all items, defects, issues, problems, breaches, errors, omissions, or other matters – regardless of severity – so that BEN may attempt to correct the same within 60 days. You agree to describe with specificity what BEN must do to fix the item, defect, issue, problem, violation, breach, or other matter. It shall never be a defense for you to say notice was futile. Your failure to give BEN notice and cure shall be admissible against you in any subsequent proceedings. In situations in which you allege defamation against BEN, your agree that your notice must give BEN notice and opportunity to retract, within 60 days, the information on BEN's system that you believe to be defamatory. If BEN does so you agree that such retraction shall act as full and complete satisfaction of any damages claim you might have had against BEN. </li>
				<li>
					<p><b>Mediation.</b> Mediation is also a pre-requisite to litigation and designed to try and resolve disputes before they become costly and time-consuming for both of us. We each agree that the cost of mediation shall be split between us evenly and we will each be required to pay an estimated fee in advance to the mediator, usually $1,000 or more for complicated cases. If either of us fails to attend this mediation, the non-appearing party shall be required to pay the entire amount of mediator's fees. </p>
					<p>We each agree that if you fail to abide by these preconditions, the arbitrator shall dismiss (not stay) any litigation you bring against BEN, and you shall be required to immediately pay BEN's reasonable attorneys' fees in having to retain counsel and defend premature litigation, as well as any initial arbitration fees incurred. If unpaid after 15 days, these sums may be reduced to their own arbitration award.  </p>
					<p>As to arbitration, the parties will agree upon and appoint single, mutually agreeable arbitrator. If the parties cannot agree upon such an arbitrator, the state district court for Jefferson County, Colorado shall appoint one.  Judgment may be entered in any court having jurisdiction hereof.  You or BEN, if either of us is a prevailing party, shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees plus reasonable costs relating to any arbitration proceeding as well as for any court proceeding, including attorneys' fees and costs for appeal and collection of any judgment obtained.  The arbitrator is instructed by the parties to issue a written opinion, as one would be handed down by a judge, including citations to the controlling legal authority that forms the basis for his opinion.  Arbitration is final and binding. In making any award, the arbitrator will be restricted by the limitation of liability and damages provision in this Agreement and will not have jurisdiction to make an award to any party to the arbitration contrary thereto.
